Adds the Challenger, a bounty hunter seeking ultimate strength through destructive power.

Passive: Battery Challenger's attacks consume energy, which recharges over time. The recharge rate is increased by attack speed. the maximum amount is increased by health, and the consumption of energy is lowered by critical strike chance. Challenger's attacks cannot critically strike

(Primary) Bisect: Challenger fires a slash of energy through the air, growing in size as it travels

(Secondary) Disect: Challenger targets a nearby enemy, slashing them apart. This attack fires more slashes the less health the enemy has

(Utility) Ignite: Challenger unleashes a bolt of flame, dealing heavy damage and setting enemies on fire. This attack has a short range and a small area of effect. If used in Overclocked Disect, a massive explosion of fire is unleashed within the designated area instead

(Special) Overclock: Challenger overclocks their next ability, changing the effects but consuming more energy.

Overclocked Bisect: Challenger unleashes a large energy slash in a targeted area, dealing heavy damage and ignoring armor

Overclocked Disect: Challenger designates an area around them, in which all enemies are continuously targeted by Disect. This ability automatically ends when Challenger falls below 40% health, when Challenger exits the area, or when activated again. Once the ability ends, Challenger's weapons overheat and cannot be used for a short period of time

Remediate (Overclocked Ignite): Challenger activates their repair systems, granting increased armor and constant healing at the cost of rapid energy drain. Activate again to cancel. This ability can be used while weapons are overheated
